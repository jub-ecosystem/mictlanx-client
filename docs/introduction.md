## Data granularity 

In MictlanX, every payload you store‚Äîwhether it starts as a memoryview, a file, or an object‚Äîis first segmented into fixed-size chunks (e.g., 256KB, 1MB). Each chunk is indexed (```0..N-1```) so it can be transmitted, retried, and verified independently. These chunks are then assembled into a ‚Äúball‚Äù, which is the logical object the system manages. A ball is identified by the pair ```(bucket_id, ball_id)``` and carries both metadata (size, checksum, content type, tags like fullname, extension, num_chunks, full_checksum) and data (the ordered set of chunks). Individual chunk keys follow the convention ```{ball_id}_{index}``` ‚Äîfor example, ```b1_0```, ```b1_1```, ‚Ä¶‚Äîwhich makes random access and streaming straightforward.

Multiple balls live inside a bucket, which serves as the namespace and lifecycle boundary for related data. Buckets then reside within a Virtual Storage Space (VSS)‚Äîthe execution domain that maps and replicates balls across storage peers. This layered design (chunks ‚Üí balls ‚Üí bucket ‚Üí VSS) lets the client pipeline large objects efficiently, recover from partial failures with fine-grained retries, verify integrity end-to-end via checksums, and scale reads/writes across healthy peers without changing application-level semantics.

**Basic Storage Units**

The figure shows how objects (balls) are represented inside the system:

- **Metadata**: A lightweight description of the ball. Think of it as the label on the ball.
- **Data**: The actual bytes of the ball. Can be streamed in ranges/chunks.
- **Ball**: A combination of Metadata + Data. This is the storage unit that lives in a bucket. Each ball is uniquely identified by its ```(bucket_id, ball_id)``` tuple.
- **Bucket**: A logical namespace that groups many balls together. Equivalent to a folder or container, identified by ```bucket_id```.

## Grouping balls üîµ
Idea: many balls (objects) can share the same ball_id. That groups them into one logical unit (a set, a timeline, a version, etc.). Each ball still has its own key, metadata, and data.


A bucket stores many balls. If you reuse the same ball_id across several balls, they become a group:
- Each ball has its own ```key```, ```size```, ```checksum```, ```content_type```, and ```tags```.
- All balls with the same ```(bucket_id, ball_id)``` belong to the same collection.
- You can list/retrieve them by ```ball_id``` to process them together.
